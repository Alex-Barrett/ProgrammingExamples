final.exe is the final project for my C++ program. It is a CSV reader that processes orders, items, and Tasks.
You must pass it 3 .dat files(included if you'd like to test), and a char delimiter('|'). It will generate png procedural png files for each.
THE .dat FILES MUST BE PRASSED IN ORDER: TASK, ITEM, ORDER, DELIMITER
final.exe should be called from the command prompt
